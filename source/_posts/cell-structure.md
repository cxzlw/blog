        Organelles all typical cells have
            Cell membrane
                Controls movement in and out of cells.
                Outer membrane of cell
                Semi-permeable
            Cytoplasm
                Where chemical reactions take place.
                Surrounded by cell membrane
                Gel-like mixture containing solutes, organelles, and water
            Nucleus
                Contains DNA and controls the cell.
                Has a nuclear membrane, so DNA is not floating about
            Mitochondria
                Where aerobic respiration happens.
                Folds: create lots of surface area for reactions
            Ribosomes
                Allows protein synthesis
                Each cell contains thousands of them
                Make proteins by translating RNA codes

                Outermost layer
                Permeable: They don't select who comes in and who leaves
            Large Vacuole
                Cell sap to keep cell turgid.
                Membrane-bound sacs for storage, digestion, and waste removal
                Contains water solution
            Chloroplast
                Contain chlorophyll, which absorbs light energy for photosynthesis.

## Organelles all typical cells have

### Cell membrane

Controls movement in and out of cells.

- Outer membrane of cell
- Semi-permeable

### Cytoplasm

Where chemical reactions take place.

- Surrounded by cell membrane
- Gel-like mixture containing solutes, orangelles, and water

### Nucleus

Contains DNA and controls the cell.

- Has a nuclear membrane, so DNA is not floating about

### Mitochondria

Where aerobic respiration happens.

- Folds: create lots of surface area for reactions

### Ribosomes

Allows protein synthesis

- Each cell contains thousands of them
- Make proteins by translating RNA codes

## Animal cell

Animal cell has all above.

### Diagram

![Animal cell diagram](../img/animal.jpg)

## Plant cell

Plant cell especially also have:

### Cell wall

Rigid to keep the shape of the cell, strengthens the cell.

- Outermost layer
- Permeable: They don't select who comes in and who leaves

### Large Vacuole

Cell sap to keep cell turgid.

- Membrane-bound sacs for storage, digestion, and waste removal
- Contains water solution

### Chloroplast

Contain chlorophyll, which absorbs light energy for photosynthesis.

- In green parts of plants

## Prokaryotic cell

Prokaryotic cell **do not** have Mitochondria and Nucleus but organelles below.

### Cell wall

Rigid to keep the shape of the cell, strengthens the cell.

- Made of __peptidoglycan__ not cellulose

### Circular DNA

Instead of chromosomes, also called _Nucleoid_, is essential for controlling the acticity and reproduction of the
prokaryotic cell.

### Plasmid

Small circles of DNA.

## Differences

### Organelles in cells

| Organelles \ Cells | Plant Cell | Animal Cell | Prokaryotic Cell |
|--------------------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| Cell Wall          | Yes        |             |                  |
| Cell Membrane      | Yes        | Yes         | Yes              |
| Chloroplasts       | Yes        |             |                  |
| Cytoplasm          | Yes        | Yes         | Yes              |
| Mitochondria       | Yes        | Yes         |                  |
| Nucleus            | Yes        | Yes         |                  |
| Ribosome           | Yes        | Yes         | Yes              |
| Large Vacuole      | Yes        |             |                  |
| Circular DNA       |            |             | Yes              |
| Plasmid            |            |             | Yes              |

### Some differences between a plant cell and an animal cell

1. A plant cell has cell wall, while an animal cell hasn't.
2. A plant cell has large vacuole, while an animal cell hasn't.
3. No animal cell has chloroplasts, but some plant cell do.

### Some differences between a plant cell and a prokaryotic cell.

1. A plant cell has nucleus, and a prokaryotic cell has nucleoid and plasmid instead.
2. Cell wall in a plant cell is made of cellulose but peptidoglycan in a prokaryotic cell.
